		<h1>MASLO Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

Q: What is MASLO?
<br />
A: MASLO stands for Mobile Access to Supplemental Learning Objects.
It is an open source software system for authoring packages of
supplemental learning materials and distributing them to mobile
devices.

<br />
<br />
Q: What platforms does MASLO deliver content to?
A: MASLO will publish to the iOS and Android platforms. As it is
an open source project, developers are free to adapt the authoring
software to publish to other platforms.

<br />
<br />
Q: Does MASLO publish to tablet devices?
<br />
A: MASLO is not designed to publish to tablet devices (i.e. iPad,
Galaxy Tab, etc.) at this time.

<br />
<br />
Q: Is MASLO a learning management system (LMS)?
<br />
A: MASLO is not an LMS. It is designed to deliver supplemental
materials for learners rather than hosting access to a full course.
For this reason, the MASLO system does not support the delivery of
traditional documents and presentations (i.e. .pdf, .doc, .ppt,
etc.). Instead it is designed to deliver content in formats that
are particularly well suited for smartphones and other handheld
mobile devices.

<br />
<br />
Q: What kinds of supplemental learning materials does the MASLO
system support?
<br />
A: Currently MASLO supports the creation and distribution of text,
image, audio, video, and quiz items.

<br />
<br />
Q: What do I need in order to set up the MASLO system for teachers
and learners in my organization or institution?
<br />
A: While the MASLO authoring tool only requires you to have Adobe
AIR installed on your personal computer, in order to distribute
content with the MASLO system you need to have the technical capacity
to stand up your own instance of the iOS and Android applications
in the iTunes App Store and Android Market, and establish an instance
of the cloud distribution system. For more information on these
technical requirements see insert link to appropriate section when
available.

<br />
<br />
Q: Can MASLO be utilized to create learner generated content?
<br />
A: There are no technical features of MASLO designed to limit the
production of learner generated content. However, because MASLO is
designed to deliver content through in app purchasing your institution
will need to develop a system that allows learners to populate
content within your versions of the player apps if you want learner
generated content in your system.
