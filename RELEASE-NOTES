MASLO v? (?)
--------

Visual/behavioral changes:
- (INCOMPLETE description) Added support for Tincan
- Added information to the "Help" screen about how to backup your MASLO
  projects.

Bug Fixes:
- <None yet>

Technical Notes:
- The underlying metadata file (named 'version') now contains more information
  including the time of last update, time of last publish, and tincan reporting
  options.  The metadata file should be correctly "upgraded" to the new format
  when importing any old projects.


MASLO v0.4 (November 30, 2012)
--------

Visual/behavioral changes:
- Changed text on the login screen from "Login as Guest" to "Work Offline".
  The functionality remains unchanged.  If you choose to "Work Offline" you
  will be prompted for your login credentials the first time you publish.
- Added the ability to rename quizzes.
- Added support for unicode characters.

Bug fixes:
- Fix for Preview Mode - displaying multiple content pieces with the same name
  now works correctly.
- Fix for renaming projects - renaming now works for projects over 60 characters
  in length.
- Fix for tooltips - fixed various bugs related to the display of tooltips that
  display when pack/content names are over a certain length (usually 60 chars)
- Fix for creating new projects - don't allow the user to create a project with
  the same name as an existing project, which would overwrite the old one.
- Fix for pack/content names - fixed various issues with using special
  characters (including %, <, and >)
